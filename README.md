# Raspberry-Pi-camera-servo-gimbal

### What is this repository for? ###

This thing is developed to put Raspberry Pi camera onto the [Neurobot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2300500) robot. It is a servo gimbal.

It is a (almost, except for one part) made-from-scartch remix of [Minimalistc FPV Board Cam Servo Gimbal for SK450](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:537211), thanks to emdzej.

Version 0.2

### How do I get set up? ###

Just print all the elements out and assemble them. The nozzle size is 0.5 mm, the layer height is 0.15 mm. The material is PLA.

Feel free to tune the thing up.
